            <p>Hello I'm Raisul Hasan Rais, a new web devloper welcome you in my first website project. This website is nothing but filled with my experience. Here, I will talk about the starting of my coding journey and future. I hope you will like this</p>
            <p>Right now, I'm studying Rajshahi Education Board Govt. Model School & Collage(R.E.B.M.S.C) in grade 8th. I live in Bangladesh, Rajshahi, and father is a Professor and my mother is a housewife.</p>

        <div id="paragraph2">

            <p>So, the journey of my coding was started in 2023 when i was in grade 6th. I have a great attraction of information techology(I.T) from my childhood. I gained a few knowledge about Graphics desinging, video editing and office work.</p>
            <p>My dad had a intel i3 computer in 2011 when i was a new born baby and I used this computer to learn coding. My computer learning started in 2014 most probably from my dad. He taught me word processing in Microsoft Word(MS Word). Then I learnt Paint, Power point amd excel myself.</p>
            <p>In the time of Covid-19 i learnt Graphics desinging(Pixellab) and Video editing(Capcut) in mobile. I was always thinking that how the Apps and Software have made. In order to finding the answer of this question i found my favourite work!!</p>

        </div>

        <div id="paragraph3">

            <p>In 2023 I wrote my first program in C. Then I quit to learn C and shifted in C++. I need more than one-year to learn C++. But, when i finished it, other programming languages became easy for me. I started to learn C again. Then i learnt most famous programming language Python, and it was insane! I have been practicing coding for tow-years and this two years i learnt a few programming languages, Html and Css. </p>

        </div>

        <h2>programming languages, I have learnt in tow-years</h2>

        <img id="i3" src="/Recourse/download.jpg" alt="programs">

        <di id="paragraph4">

            <p>In future i will try to learn more programming languages and build up new programming based skills. Also contriute myself in many solution of world wide issues with my programming knowledge.</p>
